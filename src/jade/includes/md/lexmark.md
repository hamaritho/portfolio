##Lexmark International, Inc. &mdash; Jun 2013-Aug 2013

Lexmark is primarily a printer company. They design and manufacture printers and toner. As an intern, I worked with the Firmware Security team on some printer functionality that the team wanted to implement but never seemed to have the time to do.

My first project was to add a new function to the printer so that an administrator could filter printer logs by criteria, such as the name of a user, the date, the application accessing the printer, etc.

My second project was to create a program that auto-configured a wireless printer to use the fastest server available for Kerberos authentication. It also created the Kerberos Configuration File so that users would not have to.
