##Computer Graphics Project &mdash; Oct 2013-Dec 2013

###About the Project
For Computer Graphics, we were expected to create a scene using OpenGL and C. I created a basic one-story house with no windows or doors. To make the more complex objects I found OBJ files and fixed their lighting and texturing in Blender. I then imported these objects into my scene. 

###Lessons Learned

I think the biggest thing I learned from this course and this project is that I am not too interested in the low-level workings of computer graphics. Coding objects through OpenGL, and the mathematics of lighting and shadow, were not very interesting to me. The interactions of users and the applications brought to life through graphics are what I care about.

This course helped to push me towards my interests, and for that I am grateful.
