##The Space Research Company &mdash; Jan 2015-Apr 2015

###About the Project

As part of my Technology, Arts, and Media (TAM) Minor, I worked in a team of students on a project for a client affiliated with the University of Colorado (CU). Our team worked for <a href="http://thespaceresearchcompany.com/" target="_blank">The Space Research Company</a> (TSRCo), a startup headed by a team of graduate students at CU. 

Our first task for the company was to design a branding guide, including a logo and color scheme. Originally, while working on the project, we did not know much about the company, only that they planned to manufacture Cube Satellites (CubeSats). With this small amount of knowledge, we began our designs.

The first iteration of logos heavily focused on the cube satellites. We weren&rsquo;t sure about the actual color scheme, and so for the most part we created black and white logos. The TSRCo team did not like our designs as a whole; they felt the logos limited them too much in terms of the trajectory of the company. However, a few pieces of each logo stuck out to them.

The second iteration, then, was an amalgamation of these logos. They had told us they liked the earth from one design and some of the typeface choices of other designs. We combined these to make two different versions of a singular logo and created a small branding guide for them to peruse.

Once again, TSRCo was not satisfied. Our intent to make them different from their competitors resulted in a logo they considered amateur. They also rescinded some of their earlier likes, asking us to change the direction of the logo design.

To facilitate this, we had them send us their mission statement, along with colors, typefaces, and images they wanted their company to identify with. We used this information to make simpler and cleaner logos that adhered more to their desired color scheme and general &ldquo;feel.&rdquo;

This set of logos came closer to achieving the desired goals. TSRCo was more satisfied with this set of logos, but they still felt it lacked the &ldquo;spacey&rdquo; and &ldquo;tron-y&rdquo; feel they wanted. 

For the fourth iteration of logos, we further refined based on their suggestions to different versions of a planet with orbitals. This came even closer to the desired outcome. In fact, they liked the designs a lot, but wanted some color and typeface alterations. With this iteration, we decided to end the logo design phase of the project.

In addition to the logo and branding guide, we were expected to create a power point template, a document header, a business card, and a promotional video for the company.

With the logo decided upon, the branding guide and other templates came quickly. We then only had the video left. 

The promotional video was designed as part of their pitch for the <a href="http://cunvc.org/" target="_blank">New Venture Challenge</a>. The video needed to convey their mission statement, what the company did, and inspire investors.

###Lessons Learned

The largest benefit from this project was working with clients. The company consisted of three separate students, all with varying ideas on exact details, but a common vision they wanted us to bring to life. It was great getting to work with TSRCo, even if it was sometimes difficult or frustrating to meld the creative process to specific goals. But overall I found the experience enjoyable.
