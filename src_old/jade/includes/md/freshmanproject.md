###About the Project

In my freshman year I took GEEN 1400, Engineering Projects. For this class students form groups and then design a project to be presented in a Design Exposition at the end of the semester.

My class was given free reign in choosing and designing a project as long as it had some impact/greater purpose. So we began by thinking about a need instead of a product. One of the most basic needs is water, and in third-world countries, it can be difficult to fetch. With this in mind, we designed a wind-powered water pump.

Before we could design the pump we had to research wind turbines: which turbines are the most efficient, which require the least amount of effort to begin spinning, which can self-start, etc. We discovered that there are two major types of wind turbines: vertical and horizontal. 

At first I found the terminology confusing. The blades of a classic turbine &mdash; like a pinwheel &mdash; struck me as &ldquo;vertical.&rdquo; After all, the blades moved vertically through the air. Likewise, the less-common vertical turbines&rsquo; blades moved horizontally through space. But the name of the turbine comes from the *axis* of the turbine, not the blades.

Horizontal wind turbines had a horizontal axis. The blades spun vertically around this axis. We discovered that these turbines are commercially more widespread, but usually had to be started by a generator before they could move freely in the wind. They also had to be positioned correctly to catch the wind. If the wind blew the wrong direction, the turbine was useless.

Vertical wind turbines had a vertical axis. The blades spun horizontally around this axis. We learned that these turbines are more commonly used by households or smaller companies, most could be started using the wind alone, and would work for any wind direction. They were also safer for the animal life, since it is much easier to avoid a large solid object than constantly-moving spinning blades.

We immediately saw the benefit of the vertical wind turbines and decided to use them for our project. However, further research revealed that there are two major types of vertical wind turbines: Savonius and Darrieus.

Savonius-style turbines are mostly powered by drag. They match the speed of the blowing wind and can start themselves. Darrieus-style turbines are mostly powered by lift. They can actually spin faster than the blowing wind, however they have to be initially started before spinning on their own.

We also researched different water pumps. There are three main types of water pump: Diaphragm, Rotary, and Piston. We learned that diaphragm pumps create the most pressure; they could pump more water faster than any other kind of pump. Rotary pumps are the easiest to use &mdash; simply rotate a handle. Piston pumps are the most common type of pump. 

After comparing all of our options, we opted for a savonius-style turbine and a rotary pump. We could streamline the process of using the wind turbine to crank the pump just by making sure they rotated in the same direction. We would lose the least amount of energy this way.

We took a very crude sketch then used SolidWorks to design our turbine. Since the goal was to design a low-cost water pumping system, we decided to use recycled parts in the design. We used bike wheels as the &ldquo;base&rdquo; for the blades and later decided to make the blades out of a storage shed door. We also looked at buying as many materials as possible at second-hand shops. We did, however, decide to buy a water pump; it was easily the most expensive part of our project, but well worth the cost.

Based on initial designs, we used Betz&rsquo;s Law to calculate the amount of power we could generate at 100% efficiency, and arrived at 1,072 watts. We then calculated a maximum and minimum torque for our turbine. Maximum torque we calculated to be 3.84 lb-ft, and minimum torque was 0.24 lb-ft.

We then proceeded to assemble our materials. Our first issue we ran into was that our bike wheels we had received were bent. We did our best to straighten them, but this added a lot of instability to our design we were not anticipating.

Our initial design was to have a small pole run through the base of the turbine and act as the axis for our wheels. The size of the pole was constrained by the bike wheels, as the wheels had to fit on it perfectly. We soon discovered that the thinness of the pole made our design extremely unstable. To compensate, we had to edit our base design so that it included a frame that would keep the top of the pole in place.

We decided to wedge the garage door onto the spokes of bike for the blades. This became a long and tedious process. We had to fit the garage door onto the wheels, mark where the spokes overlapped, and then notch the garage door using some knives.

Finally, we were able to attach the water pump. We attached a large gear to the base of the turbine, and then attached a smaller gear to the water pump. We used a bike chain to connect the two gears and allow the blade to turn the pump.

In our classroom, we were able to turn the turbine by hand and have the pump work, with a few caveats. First, turning the turbine required a lot of energy. The pump&rsquo;s pumping mechanism had a large amount of friction that the turbine had to overcome for it to work. In essence, an average wind could not blow hard enough to turn our pump. Secondly, the bike chain had tension issues. It would periodically fall off after a few minutes of successful turning.

However, the wind turbine itself worked like a charm. It spun in the wind at very fast rates, and had our pump had less friction, would have been able to pump the water fairly easily. 

When we had completely finished with our creation, we realized that our Bill of Materials was quite a bit higher than we had hoped. The entire project cost us about $340. Almost a third of that cost was the water pump itself. A more affordable, easier to use water pump would have greatly benefitted the turbine and its intended purpose as a low-cost way to retrieve water.

###Lessons Learned

Many of our design issues could have been avoided by simply adding more iterations to our project. In essence, our final result was really our first prototype. We never tried making our design on a smaller scale and were not able to test it in the wind until the day of the Exposition.

Going through this process, and realizing our error, helped me to better appreciate the art of engineering as well as the science of it. I learned the value of making small &ldquo;throw-aways&rdquo; that could test designs easily without expending a lot of effort. I would apply this principle in a later class, Startup Essentials. It also taught me the importance of testing often as every given opportunity, even if the entire project is not done.

This was also my first major group project. One of the unique things about group projects with faraway deadlines is that you have complete control over your learning. Everything about this project we had to research ourselves; very little fundamental engineering concepts were taught in the class. The class focused mostly on what it means to work on a project and to work in a group. As a computer scientist, I found this especially challenging. While many of the students in the class were mechanical engineers and had some experience with the concepts necessary to the class, I was mostly in the dark. Not only that, but I was very uninterested in building anything.

I wanted nothing to do with any of the mechanical equipment, I had no desire to really learn how to use different tools, and overall I found the class not very appealing.

Of course, once we began work on our projects, that changed. I still wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled with the actual building and assembling, but because I liked the idea of our project I really wanted to see it completed. My largest contribution was probably notching the blades for our turbine, and while it didn&rsquo;t seem like much, I was pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I enjoyed watching our project came together and was downright ecstatic when we had completed it, even though it wasn&rsquo;t perfect. 

Most importantly, I learned how to work with others towards a common goal. I was quite used to working by myself on a project. I didn&rsquo;t often have group projects in high school, and certainly none of this magnitude. It was my first time having to coordinate a project with four other people while still having other classes as well. In effect, it helped me learn better time management. 

Overall, I sincerely enjoyed my journey through the class, even though I had not originally been too thrilled with it, and I am glad I had the opportunity to take it.
